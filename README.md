# Random Password Generator (Console) - 30-Day Coding Challenge

**Day 8/30**

This repository contains the code for a console application that generates random passwords based on user-specified length and character types, as part of my 30-day coding challenge focused on building practical skills and a strong portfolio.

**Technologies Used:**

*    C#
*    .NET 8

Key Features:

*    Allows the user to specify the exact desired password length.
*    Enables inclusion or exclusion of character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
*    Generates a secure, randomized password directly in the console.

Learning Objectives:

*    Practiced handling user input and basic data validation in a C# console application.
*    Learned to effectively use the StringBuilder and Random classes for string manipulation and randomization.
*   Gained experience with basic project setup, debugging, and resolving environment issues within the .NET ecosystem on Linux.

How to Run:

*    Clone the repository.
*    Navigate to the project directory.
*    Run the application using the .NET CLI: dotnet run
